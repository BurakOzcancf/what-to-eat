## Overview

### What is the goal of this project?

The goal of this project is beyond just making practice about frontend skills. This website can use to cook and discover new tastes. Besides, this website's benefit, it was a really good experience for me. I used several hooks in React and used Tailwindcss for style. I have built it from scratch.

### The challenge

- Filter the food according to category
- Users should be able to click on food to see more detailed information on a separate page
